# hello-world

First repository, ye!

Wanna hear a pun? So I asked the guy sitting next to me if he had any Sodium Hypobromite... he said, "NaBrO." Sorry, that was a bad chemistry joke but all the good ones Argon. Now that that's over with, I'd like to apologize for the inconsistency of my commits, but from now on, I think I'll be doing stuff PERIODICALLY!
